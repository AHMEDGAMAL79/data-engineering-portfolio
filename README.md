# Ahmed Gamal - Data Engineering Journey

Hi, I'm Ahmed — a passionate learner transitioning into the field of **Data Engineering** from scratch.. 

This repository serves as my living portfolio and personal knowledge base, documenting my entire learning journey in a transparent and structured way. Here, you'll find my progress through foundational concepts, hands-on projects, tool explorations, and production-grade solutions as I build expertise in modern data engineering practices.

My goal is to master the end-to-end data lifecycle: from ingestion and transformation to orchestration, storage, scalability, and observability — using industry-standard tools such as Python, SQL, Apache Spark, Airflow, dbt, Kafka/Redpanda, Docker, Kubernetes, and major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).

Through consistent daily effort, real-world projects, and contributions to open-source (when ready), I aim to grow into a proficient Data Engineer capable of designing and maintaining reliable, scalable, and efficient data systems.

Thank you for visiting — feel free to explore my projects, follow along, or reach out with feedback. This journey is just beginning.

**Next milestones:** Build ETL pipelines, deploy with Airflow, master data modeling, and contribute to open-source data projects.

Let's build the future of data, one commit at a time. 🚀



### Progress Log

- **December 29, 2025:** Created the data-engineering-portfolio repository and added a professional README with bio, goals, and social links. Officially started the Data Engineering learning journey.

- - **December 30, 2025:** Started Technical English learning from the "Listening Time" YouTube channel. Completed LEVEL A1 (e.g., basic greetings and daily conversations). Focused on listening comprehension and shadowing technique. Feeling progress in understanding spoken English.

- - **December 31, 2025:** Studied English for 1 full hour (Level A1). Focused on basic conversations, vocabulary, and listening comprehension using the "Listening Time" YouTube channel. Improved confidence in understanding slow spoken English and pronunciation.
 
- - **January 1, 2026:** Studied English for 1 full hour (Level A1). Completed lessons on basic greetings, introductions, and simple sentences using the "Listening Time" channel. Practiced listening and shadowing for better pronunciation.

 - - **January 2, 2026:** Studied English for 2 full hours. Watched 1 hour of a favorite TV series for natural listening practice, followed by 1 hour continuing the Level A1 series. Noticed significant improvement in understanding spoken English with less reliance on Arabic subtitles/translations.
  
 - - **January 3, 2026:** Studied English for 3 full hours. Spent 2 hours watching a favorite TV series, focusing on new vocabulary, pronunciation, and natural listening. Followed by 1 hour of continuing Level A1 structured lessons. Noticing steady improvement in comprehension.

  Note: Considering evolving the study method to a balanced approach — 1 hour listening, 1 hour reading, 1 hour writing summaries of what I understood — to build all language skills more effectively.

 - **January 4, 2026:** Studied English for 1 hour, experimenting with the new balanced method: 30 minutes reading (A1 texts) and 30 minutes listening practice. Planning to increase study time gradually to avoid burnout and maintain consistency.

 - - **January 5, 2026:** Studied English for 1.5 hours, balancing reading, listening, and writing — felt better and more effective than previous days. Striving to increase study hours despite work fatigue, planning to switch to a job with fewer hours to dedicate more time to learning. Committed to consistency on Day 7 — Alhamdulillah. Praying to complete the 600-day plan and become a true Data Engineer from zero.
  
  - - **January 06, 2026:** Studied for 1 hour and 40 minutes, focusing on Technical English. Split time between watching episodes (for natural listening), reading materials, and direct listening practice from Listening Time channel. Improved comprehension of daily conversations and pronunciation through shadowing.
   
  - - **January 07, 2026:** Studied English for 2 hours and 30 minutes. Focused on listening, reading, and pronunciation practice. Building confidence in understanding spoken English and technical terms.
