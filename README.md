# Ahmed Gamal - Data Engineering Journey

Hi, I'm Ahmed — a passionate learner transitioning into the field of **Data Engineering** from scratch.

This repository serves as my living portfolio and personal knowledge base, documenting my entire learning journey in a transparent and structured way. Here, you'll find my progress through foundational concepts, hands-on projects, tool explorations, and production-grade solutions as I build expertise in modern data engineering practices.

My goal is to master the end-to-end data lifecycle: from ingestion and transformation to orchestration, storage, scalability, and observability — using industry-standard tools such as Python, SQL, Apache Spark, Airflow, dbt, Kafka/Redpanda, Docker, Kubernetes, and major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).

Through consistent daily effort, real-world projects, and contributions to open-source (when ready), I aim to grow into a proficient Data Engineer capable of designing and maintaining reliable, scalable, and efficient data systems.

Thank you for visiting — feel free to explore my projects, follow along, or reach out with feedback. This journey is just beginning.

**Currently learning:** Technical English → Linux & Bash → Git → Advanced Python & SQL → Big Data & Cloud Fundamentals  

**Next milestones:** Build ETL pipelines, deploy with Airflow, master data modeling, and contribute to open-source data projects.

Let's build the future of data, one commit at a time. 🚀



### Progress Log

- **December 29, 2025:** Created the data-engineering-portfolio repository and added a professional README with bio, goals, and social links. Officially started the Data Engineering learning journey.

- - **December 30, 2025:** Started Technical English learning from the "Listening Time" YouTube channel. Completed X videos (e.g., basic greetings and daily conversations). Focused on listening comprehension and shadowing technique. Feeling progress in understanding spoken English.
